# SpaceInvaders

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where players control a spaceship that must defend against waves of invading alien forces. The objective is to shoot and destroy as many aliens as possible while avoiding their projectiles. The game gets progressively harder as the player successfully defeats waves of aliens.
